Whether you’re a technology company rolling out new API versions to millions of users, or a financial services organization conducting A/B tests to optimize customer experiences, the ability to route API traffic dynamically and efficiently is essential.\nToday, Amazon API Gateway announces support for dynamic routing rules for custom domain names in all supported AWS Regions. This new capability enables you to route API requests based on HTTP header values, either independently or in combination with URL paths. In this post, you will learn how to use this new capability to implement routing strategies such as API versioning and gradual rollouts without modifying your API endpoints.\nDynamic Routing Rules Overview Many organizations require dynamic API routing capabilities to support their evolving business needs. As a line-of-business persona, you want to be able to test new user experiences with specific customer segments, while maintaining their existing flows intact. As an engineer, you want to be able to maintain multiple API versions across different client applications while ensuring regulatory compliance. Prior to this launch, developers using API Gateway implemented dynamic routing by using different URL paths, such as “/v1/products” and “/v2/products”.\nWith this new launch, you can implement dynamic routing logic with a simple declarative configuration within the custom domain name settings. The new routing rule mechanism allows you to make routing decisions based on HTTP headers, base paths, or a combination of both. Developers are no longer required to create new or alter existing paths to smoothly transition between API versions, they can simply specify the desired value in the request HTTP header. Among other possibilities, you can implement cell-based architecture routing, A/B testing, or dynamic backend selection based on hostname, tenant ID, accepted response media type, or cookie value. By implementing routing logic directly within the API Gateway, you can eliminate proxy layers and complex URL structures while maintaining fine-grained control over your API traffic. This new feature seamlessly integrates with existing API Gateway capabilities and supports both public and private REST APIs. The following diagram shows how you can use routing rules for header and base-path based routing. This example uses a single level resource /products to show path matching, however depending on your use-case you could also use multi-level paths like /products/items.\nFigure 1. Using routing rules for header and base-path based routing\nIn the following section you’ll learn how to implement header-based routing, use the new routing rules construct for common scenarios like API versioning and A/B testing, and configure rules with different routing conditions and priorities to achieve the desired behavior.\nWhat is a routing rule\nA routing rule is a new resource type uniquely associated with a single custom domain. It represents a collection of conditions that, when matched, cause the incoming request to be forwarded to a specific API and stage. Routing rules have three configuration properties:\nThe Conditions property defines the criteria that must be met for actions to be taken. A rule can include up to two header conditions and one base path condition, and all specified conditions must be met to trigger the action. If no conditions are defined for a rule, it serves as a catch-all rule matching all requests.\nThe Actions property defines what actions will be taken when rule conditions are met. At the time of this launch the supported action is invoking any stage of any REST API within the same account and region boundaries.\nThe Priority property defines the order that rules are evaluated in, with 1 being highest priority and 1,000,000 the lowest. You cannot reuse same priority value for more than one rule. AWS recommends you leave ample space between sequential rules to make it easy to add new rules in future, for example use 100, 200, 300 instead of 1, 2, 3.\nHeader conditions, specified via a MatchHeaders property, are used to match HTTP request header values, such as x-version=v1. Conforming to RFC 7230, header names are not case sensitive, while header values are. You can also use wildcards in header values for prefix, suffix, and contains match. See the following examples using AWS CloudFormation templates:\nExact match:\n- MatchHeaders: AnyOf: - Header: \u0026#34;x-version\u0026#34; ValueGlob: \u0026#34;alpha-v2-latest\u0026#34; Will only match x-version=alpha-v2-latest\nPrefix match:\n- MatchHeaders: AnyOf: - Header: \u0026#34;x-version\u0026#34; ValueGlob: \u0026#34;*latest\u0026#34; Matches x-version=alpha-v2-latest, but not x-version=alpha-v2\nSuffix match:\n- MatchHeaders: AnyOf: - Header: \u0026#34;x-version\u0026#34; ValueGlob: \u0026#34;alpha*\u0026#34; Will match x-version=alpha-v2-latest and x-version=alpha-v1, but not x-version=beta-v1\nPrefix and suffix match.\n- MatchHeaders: AnyOf: - Header: \u0026#34;x-version\u0026#34; ValueGlob: \u0026#34;*v2*\u0026#34; Matches x-version=alpha-v2-latest and x-version=beta-v2-test, but not x-version=alpha-v1\nBase path condition, specified via MatchBasePaths property, is used to match the incoming request path. The matching is case sensitive.\n- MatchBasePaths: AnyOf: - \u0026#34;products\u0026#34; You can have up to two MatchHeaders and one MatchBasePaths conditions per routing rule. Conditions are evaluated using the AND operator, meaning all conditions must be met for the action to be taken. Both condition types support a single comparison value under AnyOf property. The following snippet illustrates a sample routing rule with two MatchHeaders conditions and a single MatchBasePaths condition.\nProductsV1RoutingRule: Type: \u0026#39;AWS::ApiGatewayV2::RoutingRule\u0026#39; Properties: DomainNameArn: !Sub \u0026#34;arn:aws:apigateway:${AWS::Region}::/domainnames/${ApiCustomDomain}\u0026#34; Priority: 100 Conditions: - MatchHeaders: AnyOf: - Header: \u0026#34;x-version\u0026#34; ValueGlob: \u0026#34;v2\u0026#34; - MatchHeaders: AnyOf: - Header: \u0026#34;x-user-cohort\u0026#34; ValueGlob: \u0026#34;beta-testers\u0026#34; - MatchBasePaths: AnyOf: - \u0026#34;products\u0026#34; Actions: - InvokeApi: ApiId: !Ref ProductsV2Api Stage: !Ref ProductsV2Stage This rule matches requests to https://example.com/products when both header conditions are met – x-version=v2 and x-user-cohort=beta-testers. This rule does not match requests to any other base path, such as https://example.com/orders, or requests that do not match at least one header condition.\nFor scenarios like API versioning, you can create rules that evaluate headers such as “accept” or “version” to route traffic to different API implementations. For example, to route requests containing “x-version: api-beta” to your beta API, you would create a rule specifying this header condition and set the action to route to your beta API deployment.\nHeader-based routing also simplifies A/B testing by allowing you to define client cohorts based on custom headers, allowing controlled experiments with different configurations. You can create rules that check for a custom header like “x-test-group” to route specific users to different API implementations. The priority system ensures predictable routing behavior – when multiple rules match a request, the rule with the lowest priority number (highest precedence) determines the routing. Combining header and path conditions within a single rule enables complex routing scenarios such as version-specific routing for specific API resources instead of the entire API, as illustrated in the following diagram.\nFigure 2. A routing configuration with two header and one path conditions in API Gateway Console.\nReview the API Gateway documentation for detailed guide on creating routing rules.\nConfiguring Routing Mode\nBefore you begin creating routing rules, you must first create at least one API, stage, and a custom domain name. You can configure your custom domain name with the new routing mode setting.\nAPI mappings only. This is the default mode. When using this mode, you can continue to use base path mappings to route requests to different APIs, and not use Routing Rules at all. This mode maintains the current behavior, where requests are routed based on base path mappings only.\nRouting rules then API mappings. With this mode you can use Routing Rules while continuing to keep base path mappings as a fallback. When you use this mode, the Routing Rules always take precedence, and unmatched requests are evaluated against base path mappings. This mode is useful for gradually transitioning your APIs to Routing Rules.\nRouting rules only. This mode gives you the flexibility to use routing rules only, and not rely on the base paths that you may have previously created on the domain using API mappings. This is the recommended routing mode; it is helpful when you are starting off with a new custom domain or finished transitioning from API mappings to Routing Rules for an existing custom domain.\nWhen switching from one routing mode to another, always test your new configuration in non-production environments first. For example, when switching mode from API mappings only to routing rules only, your traffic will only be routed with routing rules; existing API mappings will no longer take effect.\nOnboarding to Header-Based Routing\nYou can adopt the new Header-Based Routing for your existing API Gateway custom domains with zero-downtime, risk-minimized approach. The first step is to configure your custom domain to use the Routing rules then API mappings mode using the API Gateway console, AWS CLI, or your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool. This configuration ensures that while you gradually create Routing Rules, your existing base path mappings continue to function as fallback routes. Since Routing Rules are evaluated before base path mappings, and in the absence of any matching rules, requests automatically fall back to your existing base path mappings, your current API traffic remains unaffected during this transition.\nObservability\nAPI Gateway provides comprehensive visibility into how your routing rules are processing requests through access logging. Each request now includes additional context variables that help you understand the routing decision process. The $context.customDomain.routingRuleIdMatched variable identifies which rule was matched and applied to the request, while existing variables like $context.domainName, $context.apiId, and $context.stage provide the complete routing context. By analyzing these access logs, you can verify routing behavior, troubleshoot unexpected routes, and gather insights about traffic patterns across different API versions or test variants.\nEnd-to-end example\nConsider a real-world scenario where a team needs to gradually migrate users to a new API version, such as an e-commerce platform updating its checkout API from v1 to v2. First, the team creates two different REST APIs – one for each version. Then, they set up a Routing Rule with priority 100 that checks for the header x-version=v2 and routes matching requests to the v2 API. They also create another rule with priority 200 that routes all requests with paths starting with /checkout to v1 API as a fallback.\nFigure 3. Gradually transitioning clients from v1 to v2 API.\nIn the application code they add the x-version header for a small percentage of users. They monitor the performance and error rates using API Gateway’s telemetry capabilities by tracking the access and execution logs, along with emitted metrics. As their confidence grows, they gradually increase the percentage of users sending the v2 header. This approach ensures a controlled migration with minimal risk and ability to quickly rollback by simply removing the header from requests or changing a routing rule.\nSample\nFollow the instructions in this GitHub repository to provision the sample in your AWS account. The project illustrates using dynamic routing with API Gateway.\nConclusion\nHeader-based routing brings significant advantages to API Gateway users. The feature’s backward compatibility ensures a smooth transition path – you can maintain existing base path mappings while gradually adopting Routing Rules, or use both mechanisms simultaneously with the fallback option. This flexibility allows you to migrate at your own pace without disrupting existing applications. The solution is cost-effective, with no additional charges for using Routing Rules on REST APIs. It reduces requirements to leverage extra service and infrastructure for dynamic routing. The priority-based evaluation system provides deterministic routing behavior, making it easier to understand and troubleshoot routing decisions.\nTo learn more about API Gateway header-based routing see the service documentation.\nTo learn more about Serverless architectures see Serverless Land.\n"},{"uri":"https://addavid888.github.io/AWS-FCJ-Internship/4-eventparticipated/4.1-event1/","title":"Event 1","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Summary Report: AWS Cloud Day Vietnam 2025 - AI Edition (Live Telecast \u0026amp; Sessions) Event Objectives Bring together businesses, builders, and leaders in Vietnam to drive cloud and AI innovation, supporting national digital transformation.

To address these challenges, Amazon Q Developer has expanded its intelligent coding assistant capabilities to Visual Studio and JetBrains Integrated development environments (IDEs). This new agentic experience works proactively on your behalf, automatically analyzing your workspace, generating code fixes, and executing commands to streamline your development workflow.\nIn this blog post, we’ll explore how Amazon Q Developer automates unit test creation and execution to validate code changes, streamlines build processes by identifying and resolving common issues.\nIn May 2025, our colleague Brian Beach wrote about the new agentic coding experience in Amazon Q Developer for VS Code. By extending the agentic experience to Visual Studio and JetBrains IDEs, Amazon Q Developer now brings intelligent automation to even more developers.\nBenefits for Developers\nAmazon Q Developer transforms the way developers work by seamlessly integrating AI assistance into their daily workflow without switching contexts or leaving their preferred development environment. Using features like @workspace and @files, you can get highly relevant recommendations in your IDE. With Q Developer’s ability to take actions like generating code diffs and running commands, you can automate repetitive coding tasks, implement complex features faster, and troubleshoot issues without breaking your flow. With support for multiple languages including English, Mandarin, Japanese, and Spanish, Amazon Q Developer makes advanced AI assistance accessible to development teams worldwide, fostering inclusive collaboration across global organizations.\nMaximizing Development Efficiency with Amazon Q Developer\nAmazon Q Developer revolutionizes your development workflow by offering a comprehensive set of capabilities within your IDE. Let’s explore how this powerful tool leverages context to enhance your coding experience by using context features, codebase’s folders and rules.\nYou can explicitly guide Q Developer by defining specific files or folders in the prompt context. Don’t know where to find particular information? No problem! Q Developer can efficiently navigate through your codebase using @workspaces to gather relevant code snippets from multiple files. This is particularly important when you want to create documentation that spans multiple files or when you need to fix a bug and have no idea where you should start.\nThe agentic chat feature automatically derives context from the codebase’s folders and executes commands on your behalf. It has the same intelligent reasoning capability used in the Q Developer CLI, which has already won the hearts of many developers.\nContext management extends to configuration through the .amazonq/rules/ directory. Within this directory, you can define rules for coding standards, testing requirements, security protocols, and documentation practices. Some customers have already created a rule that defines how Q Developer commits changes. This rule provides a template for a Git commit that details the message and for the agentic actions that modify files. It makes it much easier to identify and review the contributions of the Q Developer to your codebase.\nQuick Tour of the Agentic Experience\nLet us walk you through two use cases. In our example, we will use the Visual Studio IDE. Similar agentic capabilities are now supported in JetBrains IDEs as well. We invite you to follow along by cloning the Bob’s Used Books sample repo and opening it in Visual Studio 2022. Don’t forget to add or update the Amazon Q Developer extension.\nCreating unit tests\nThe Bookstore.Domain project contains domain objects such as Book and ShoppingCart.\nFigure 1: Domain objects in Bookstore.Domain\nWe have a separate project called Bookstore.Domain.Tests that contains tests for the Book class.\nFigure 2: Tests for Book class\nWe want to add unit tests for the ShoppingCart class. Let’s ask Amazon Q Developer to create unit tests for ShoppingCart. We also want Amazon Q Developer to follow the existing pattern of creating test classes in a separate test project.\nBy default, the agentic experience is on. If you are in the planning phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and prefer to use a traditional back-and-forth chat, you can turn the agentic experience. To toggle the agentic experience on and off, choose the angle bracket pair in the bottom left corner of your Q Developer chat window.\nThen, we ask Q Developer “Can you create a test for @ShoppingCart.cs? Look at existing test and use the same libraries”. First, notice that we are giving a command instead of just asking a question. Second, we are referencing the file ShoppingCart.cs explicitly to provide Q Developer the appropriate context. In the following image, you can see that Q Developer is acting on our behalf. In agentic coding mode, Q Developer can take actions and run commands. In our example, it is reading files, writing to files, and running commands with your permission.\nFigure 3: Prompt to create new tests\nUsing commands, Q Developer was able to analyze our solution structure, understand that we have a project called Bookstore.Domain.Tests, and create a new file containing unit tests for ShoppingCart.\nFigure 4: Summary of test cases\nWe can verify that there is a new file called ShoppingCartTests in the Bookstore.Domain.Tests project, which is aligned with our existing test creation strategy.\nFigure 5: New file with generated test cases\nIn Visual Studio, we can now run the unit tests and verify that they pass.\nFigure 6: Successful test run of new tests\nResolving build errors\nIn the following example, we will demonstrate the power of the agentic coding experience by using Q Developer to build our application and resolve build errors.\nIn our example, we have deliberately misspelled one of the methods in the IShoppingCartRepository interface. The AddAsync method is now incorrectly spelled AddAsyn.\nFigure 7: Spelling mistake in a method name\nWhen we try to build the Bookstore.Domain project, we get a build error as expected. Let’s ask Q Developer to fix the error. Without the agentic coding experience, we would have to copy the text of the build error into the chat window and ask Q Developer to provide recommendations. Then we would have to act on its recommendations by manually making changes and trying to build. This is one of many examples of the power of the agentic chat, which runs commands and uses the command’s output to enrich the context of the prompt to take actions.\nWith the agentic coding experience, we just ask Q Developer “Can you fix the error I am getting while building the solution? Please build and check it”. In the following image, you will see how Q Developer runs the .NET build commands to get build errors and read the relevant files.\nFigure 8: Building the solution\nAfter it reads the files, it finds the spelling mistake and fixes it automatically. As shown in the following image, it then builds the solution to verify that its fix worked.\nFigure 9: Fixing the spelling mistake\nIn the following image, Amazon Q Developer provides a summary of the error, the actions it took to build it. It even helps me with some recommendations to fix the warnings it got while running the build.\nFigure 10: Summary of changes and suggestions\nConclusion\nThe addition of Amazon Q Developer’s agentic experience in Microsoft Visual Studio and JetBrains IDEs takes Amazon Q Developer beyond traditional chat-based interactions to intelligent, action-oriented assistance. The ability to automatically read files, generate code diffs, run shell commands, and validate changes demonstrates a level of autonomy that can significantly accelerate development tasks while maintaining code quality. The examples we’ve explored, from automated test creation to build error resolution, showcase how the agentic experience can streamline common development tasks that traditionally required multiple manual steps. This new capability, combined with multi-language support and customizable development standards, makes Amazon Q Developer a powerful ally in modern software development workflows. As development teams continue to seek ways to improve productivity without compromising code quality, Amazon Q Developer’s agentic experience represents a meaningful step forward in IDE-integrated AI assistance. Whether you’re writing tests, fixing bugs, or optimizing code, the ability to have an AI assistant that can not only suggest solutions but also implement them while maintaining context awareness is a game-changing addition to the developer’s toolkit.\n"},{"uri":"https://addavid888.github.io/AWS-FCJ-Internship/3-blogstranslated/3.3-blog3/","title":"Location Intelligence for Sustainable Transportation on AWS","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Click here to read the orignal post\nby Mahesh Geeniga, Lev Levine, and Nicolas Legros on 14 MAY 2025\nBy Mahesh Geeniga, Senior Partner Solutions Architect – AWS, Lev Levine, Principal Partner Development Manager – AWS, Nicolas Legros, Director Product Marketing – HERE Technologies\nLocation intelligence, powered by real-time geospatial data, is revolutionizing transportation and logistics by enabling businesses to optimize routes, reduce fuel consumption, and minimize environmental impact while meeting the growing demands of a global economy.\nHERE Technologies, in collaboration with AWS, delivers advanced location intelligence solutions, including smart routing, real-time traffic monitoring, and sophisticated last-mile delivery planning. These solutions help companies reduce emissions while optimizing their deliveries, fleet management, and overall performance.\nIn this blog, you will explore how HERE’s next-generation mapping solutions on Amazon Web Services (AWS) are helping businesses achieve their sustainability goals. These solutions demonstrate that companies can maintain operational efficiency while being environmentally responsible.\nSmart Route Optimization\nHERE Technologies, a location intelligence leader, relies on AWS Cloud infrastructure for its advanced routing and navigation solutions, such as the HERE Fleet Optimization solution. AWS services, including Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and AWS Batch, enable HERE to process massive amounts of real-time and historical data, transforming it into advanced routing intelligence.\nThe HERE Tour Planning API optimizes entire vehicle fleets by creating routes that save both time and money. By using AWS Graviton processors, HERE improves the API’s performance while lowering customer costs. The API creates balanced routes while optimizing vehicle usage, incorporating various operational constraints such as driver shift patterns and specific job timing requirements. It features real-time, traffic-aware routing specifically designed for trucks, with the ability to dynamically replan routes based on current vehicle positions. The API intelligently matches specific job requirements with vehicle capabilities, such as refrigerated transport, while coordinating multiple vehicles to reduce overall travel time and fuel usage. Through its consideration of strict delivery windows and real-time traffic and roadway environment conditions, the API allows reliable delivery performance while maintaining the flexibility to adapt routes as conditions change.\nFigure 1 shows how HERE Fleet Optimization addresses various fleet management problems.\nFigure 1: Typical architecture utilizing HERE Fleet Optimization\nEmissions-Focused Routing based on Real-Time Intelligence\nHERE’s advanced routing system transforms traditional navigation by balancing environmental efficiency, cost, and speed. It employs robust algorithms that analyze multiple real-time variables to determine the most sustainable route for each journey. This intelligent approach considers that even minor variations in traffic patterns, vehicle specifications, or environmental conditions can impact fuel consumption and emissions.\nThe advanced routing tools continuously process real-time traffic data and provide updated routing information through HERE’s APIs. Fleet management systems implementing HERE’s routing capabilities can actively request new route calculations when needed, allowing them to respond to changes in road environmental conditions (such as changes in traffic regulations), accidents, construction work or other road conditions. By implementing these rerouting capabilities and invoking HERE’s APIs at appropriate intervals, systems can help vehicles avoid congestion and stop-and-go traffic. This approach reduces idle time and unnecessary acceleration, which are two major sources of excessive emissions.\nIntegrating HERE Real-Time Traffic and road alert features further enhances the intelligent routing system. These features provide quick updates about road conditions and potential hazards, enabling vehicles to maintain consistent speeds and avoid traffic bottlenecks. Different route options can be assessed for fuel efficiency and environmental effect via projected emissions comparison. The system evaluates predicted emissions for different routing options, comparing potential fuel consumption and environmental impact. While a suggested route may appear longer in distance, its forecasted emissions could be lower by avoiding predicted congestion zones, ultimately offering environmentally efficient path options. This comprehensive approach to routing combines real-time traffic data with vehicle-specific characteristics and environmental factors. By considering these multiple variables, businesses can achieve reductions in fuel consumption, idle time, and carbon emissions compared to traditional navigation approaches that focus solely on travel time or distance.\nVehicle Telematics\nHERE’s routing system can integrate with vehicle telematics to monitor environmental performance metrics when CAN bus data access is available. The system can analyze several key aspects for fleets with connected vehicle data, including actual fuel consumption data gathered from vehicles, patterns in driver behavior that impact efficiency, and opportunities to optimize routes and schedules.\nThis visibility enables fleet managers to make data-driven decisions about routing efficiency, driver coaching, and operational improvements. The insights help organizations measure and achieve their emissions reduction targets. However, monitoring actual fuel consumption relies specifically on vehicle data connectivity and access to CAN bus systems.\nEnhanced Visibility Solutions\nLast Mile delivery presents unique challenges in urban environments, where complicated traffic patterns and frequent stops significantly impact emissions. HERE’s shipment visibility combines data from multiple tracking sources – including IoT sensors and telematics systems – and enhances this information with precise location data. This gives customers a complete view of their shipments by integrating and enriching data from various tracking devices and platforms. This enhancement process maps positional information to precise locations, enabling real-time monitoring of delivery status against planned routes and schedules.\nThe platform evaluates whether shipments are running on time, behind schedule, or ahead of expectations, enabling fleet managers to monitor shipment progress comprehensively. Through real-time tracking of vehicle positions and delivery status, managers can assess schedule adherence and delivery performance while evaluating route compliance and timing variations. This visibility allows them to make dynamic adjustments as needed to optimize delivery efficiency across their operations.\nThis enhanced visibility allows operations teams to proactively address delays, optimize routing decisions, and remove unnecessary fuel consumption per package across the final delivery segment.\nWeather-Informed Decisions\nHERE Destination Weather is a dynamic (live) service delivering granular, up-to-the-minute, accurate and contextual local weather information to improve driver awareness and safety. The service provides current conditions, forecasts, severe weather alerts, and changing conditions along a journey. By integrating this detailed weather data into route planning, fleet managers can make smarter decisions, avoiding weather-related delays and increased fuel costs. This proactive approach helps optimize routes by considering current and predicted weather impacts on travel conditions.\nMeasurable Customer Outcomes\nThe implementation of HERE’s solutions has demonstrated significant environmental and business value, with the extent of benefits varying based on a company’s baseline. For organizations new to computer-based route optimization, these technologies can achieve up to 20% reduction in route times, fuel costs, and carbon footprint through efficient route planning and delivery optimization. Companies already using basic digitized routing solutions typically see gains of 5-8%, potentially reaching 10%, when upgrading to more advanced systems.\nConclusion\nBy combining geospatial data, advanced routing algorithms, and comprehensive fleet management capabilities, businesses can now achieve their environmental goals without compromising operational efficiency. As organizations worldwide face increasing pressure to reduce their environmental footprint, HERE’s technology stack, available through AWS Marketplace, offers a proven pathway to sustainable operations while maintaining competitive advantage in the global supply chain.\nHERE Location Services and HERE Tour Planning are available as SaaS offerings in AWS Marketplace and have trial offers to help fleet customers test the solutions.

Executive Summary Rafilm is a Letterboxd-inspired movie logging and recommendation platform designed to help general users track their watched films, share reviews, and discover new favorites through AI-powered recommendations. Built as part of the AWS First Cloud Journey (FCJ) internship, Rafilm integrates Amazon Personalize and Bedrock to deliver tailored movie suggestions and conversational recommendations via a chatbot interface.\nThe platform runs fully on AWS Serverless architecture, featuring Amplify-hosted Next.js frontend, Lambda-based backend services connected through API Gateway, and DynamoDB for scalable user and movie data storage. TMDb provides external movie data integration, while Amazon Cognito manages user authentication. Rafilm aims to demonstrate a scalable, intelligent, and cost-efficient architecture capable of supporting multi-user access and interactive experiences.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? While existing movie platforms like Letterboxd and IMDb offer robust logging and social features, they lack personalized recommendation systems and interactive discovery experiences. Users often rely on external sources or generic trending lists to find what to watch next, leading to irrelevant or repetitive suggestions.\nThe Solution Rafilm integrates a custom recommendation pipeline powered by Amazon Personalize, combined with a Bedrock LLM chatbot that interprets user preferences and generates conversational movie recommendations. Users can log movies, write reviews, and receive curated suggestions—all within one seamless experience. Unlike Letterboxd, Rafilm focuses on data-driven personalization and AI-assisted interaction rather than pure social networking.\nBenefits and Return on Investment By leveraging AWS Serverless services, Rafilm achieves near-zero maintenance cost, pay-per-use scalability, and real-time AI-driven personalization. For the FCJ internship, the project serves as both a technical showcase and a learning artifact for integrating AI services in serverless architectures. Projected cost remains under $1/month during testing, with AWS Free Tier coverage for most usage.\n3. Solution Architecture Rafilm employs a modular serverless architecture using AWS services for scalability, integration, and cost optimization.\nAWS Services Used AWS Amplify: Hosts the Next.js frontend for movie browsing, logging, and chatbot interaction. Amazon Cognito: Handles user registration, login, and session management. Amazon API Gateway: Routes client requests to backend Lambda functions. AWS Lambda: Executes serverless business logic (e.g., CRUD for reviews, fetching TMDb data, triggering recommendations). Amazon DynamoDB: Stores user logs, movie interactions, and preferences. Amazon Personalize: Trains and serves personalized recommendation models. Amazon Bedrock: Provides conversational chatbot functionality for recommendation dialogue. Amazon S3: Stores static assets and backups for logs and model outputs. Component Design Frontend (Next.js): User-friendly interface for movie discovery, logging, and chat-based recommendations. Backend (Lambda + API Gateway): Stateless logic layer handling user operations, movie fetching, and recommendation retrieval. Data Layer (DynamoDB + S3): Stores structured user interactions and movie metadata for model training. AI Layer (Personalize + Bedrock): Personalize analyzes historical user interactions; Bedrock chatbot provides natural language access to personalized results. Authentication (Cognito): Securely manages multi-user access. Architecture Overview Users log in via Cognito and interact with the Next.js interface. Actions such as logging or rating trigger API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB workflows. The Bedrock chatbot accesses Personalize results to generate conversational movie suggestions. Amplify hosts the frontend for seamless deployment and scalability. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases Architecture Design (Month 1): Research AWS serverless and AI integration patterns; finalize architecture diagrams. Prototype Integration (Month 2): Implement Amplify hosting, Cognito authentication, and Lambda-based backend APIs. Recommendation System (Month 3): Connect Personalize and Bedrock for end-to-end AI recommendation and chatbot response. Testing \u0026amp; Deployment: Conduct functional testing, optimize costs, and deploy production-ready version on Amplify. Technical Requirements Frontend: Next.js + React hosted via AWS Amplify, using TMDb API for movie data. Backend: AWS Lambda (Node.js runtime) connected through API Gateway. Database: Amazon DynamoDB for scalable user and review data. AI Components: Amazon Personalize (user-item recommendations) and Bedrock (chatbot dialogue). Authentication: Amazon Cognito for secure, multi-user access. Automation: AWS SDK \u0026amp; CloudFormation for provisioning; AWS SAM for deployment workflows. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Phase Duration Key Deliverables Month 1 Research \u0026amp; Architecture AWS design finalizing Month 2 Core Development Amplify hosting, Cognito setup, Lambda API, DynamoDB schema Month 3 AI Integration \u0026amp; Testing Personalize training, Bedrock chatbot, system deployment Post-Launch Continuous Improvement Cost optimization, new features, UX refinement 6. Budget Estimation Estimated Monthly Cost: $40.09 USD ($481.08 for 12 months)\nThe cost estimate of this project is projected in this link: https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=dab7fb57dabfb76041cdba98ac2bac7ba9630046\nThe monthly cost estimate of $40.09 USD is calculated based on the following specific usage assumptions derived from the AWS Pricing Calculator:\nStandard Usage: Assumes 10,000 requests per month for both AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. User Base: Assumes a maximum of 10,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU) for Amazon Cognito. AI/ML Usage (Primary Cost Driver): Amazon Bedrock is estimated for continuous operation (24 hours per day) with an average of 1 request per minute and 100 input/output tokens per request. Amazon Personalize includes 1 GB of data ingested and 15 training hours per month. Security Overhead: Assumes use of 1 AWS WAF Web ACL with 4 Rules and 3 Managed Rule Groups. Data Storage: Assumes 0.5 GB of data storage in Amazon DynamoDB. 7. Risk Assessment Risk Probability Impact Mitigation API rate limits from TMDb Medium Medium Cache requests via Lambda Model training cost escalation Low Medium Use limited training dataset for testing Chatbot latency Medium Low Optimize Bedrock model type and response size Authentication or token expiry Medium Low Use short-lived JWTs and refresh tokens 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements Demonstrates serverless integration of AI/ML and LLM services in real-world use. Establishes a reusable AWS architecture for recommendation-based apps. Long-Term Value Provides a foundation for future expansion into a social movie discovery network. Serves as an AWS FCJ internship showcase project highlighting scalability, personalization, and conversational AI.

Executive Summary The IoT Weather Platform is designed for the ITea Lab team in Ho Chi Minh City to enhance weather data collection and analysis. It supports up to 5 weather stations, with potential scalability to 10-15, utilizing Raspberry Pi edge devices with ESP32 sensors to transmit data via MQTT. The platform leverages AWS Serverless services to deliver real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and cost efficiency, with access restricted to 5 lab members via Amazon Cognito.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? Current weather stations require manual data collection, becoming unmanageable with multiple units. There is no centralized system for real-time data or analytics, and third-party platforms are costly and overly complex.\nThe Solution The platform uses AWS IoT Core to ingest MQTT data, AWS Lambda and API Gateway for processing, Amazon S3 for storage (including a data lake), and AWS Glue Crawlers and ETL jobs to extract, transform, and load data from the S3 data lake to another S3 bucket for analysis. AWS Amplify with Next.js provides the web interface, and Amazon Cognito ensures secure access. Similar to Thingsboard and CoreIoT, users can register new devices and manage connections, though this platform operates on a smaller scale and is designed for private use. Key features include real-time dashboards, trend analysis, and low operational costs.\nBenefits and Return on Investment The solution establishes a foundational resource for lab members to develop a larger IoT platform, serving as a study resource, and provides a data foundation for AI enthusiasts for model training or analysis. It reduces manual reporting for each station via a centralized platform, simplifying management and maintenance, and improves data reliability. Monthly costs are $0.66 USD per the AWS Pricing Calculator, with a 12-month total of $7.92 USD. All IoT equipment costs are covered by the existing weather station setup, eliminating additional development expenses. The break-even period of 6-12 months is achieved through significant time savings from reduced manual work.\n3. Solution Architecture The platform employs a serverless AWS architecture to manage data from 5 Raspberry Pi-based stations, scalable to 15. Data is ingested via AWS IoT Core, stored in an S3 data lake, and processed by AWS Glue Crawlers and ETL jobs to transform and load it into another S3 bucket for analysis. Lambda and API Gateway handle additional processing, while Amplify with Next.js hosts the dashboard, secured by Cognito. The architecture is detailed below:\nAWS Services Used AWS IoT Core: Ingests MQTT data from 5 stations, scalable to 15. AWS Lambda: Processes data and triggers Glue jobs (two functions). Amazon API Gateway: Facilitates web app communication. Amazon S3: Stores raw data in a data lake and processed outputs (two buckets). AWS Glue: Crawlers catalog data, and ETL jobs transform and load it. AWS Amplify: Hosts the Next.js web interface. Amazon Cognito: Secures access for lab users. Component Design Edge Devices: Raspberry Pi collects and filters sensor data, sending it to IoT Core. Data Ingestion: AWS IoT Core receives MQTT messages from the edge devices. Data Storage: Raw data is stored in an S3 data lake; processed data is stored in another S3 bucket. Data Processing: AWS Glue Crawlers catalog the data, and ETL jobs transform it for analysis. Web Interface: AWS Amplify hosts a Next.js app for real-time dashboards and analytics. User Management: Amazon Cognito manages user access, allowing up to 5 active accounts. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases This project has two parts—setting up weather edge stations and building the weather platform—each following 4 phases:\nBuild Theory and Draw Architecture: Research Raspberry Pi setup with ESP32 sensors and design the AWS serverless architecture (1 month pre-internship) Calculate Price and Check Practicality: Use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs and adjust if needed (Month 1). Fix Architecture for Cost or Solution Fit: Tweak the design (e.g., optimize Lambda with Next.js) to stay cost-effective and usable (Month 2). Develop, Test, and Deploy: Code the Raspberry Pi setup, AWS services with CDK/SDK, and Next.js app, then test and release to production (Months 2-3). Technical Requirements\nWeather Edge Station: Sensors (temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed), a microcontroller (ESP32), and a Raspberry Pi as the edge device. Raspberry Pi runs Raspbian, handles Docker for filtering, and sends 1 MB/day per station via MQTT over Wi-Fi. Weather Platform: Practical knowledge of AWS Amplify (hosting Next.js), Lambda (minimal use due to Next.js), AWS Glue (ETL), S3 (two buckets), IoT Core (gateway and rules), and Cognito (5 users). Use AWS CDK/SDK to code interactions (e.g., IoT Core rules to S3). Next.js reduces Lambda workload for the fullstack web app. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Project Timeline\nPre-Internship (Month 0): 1 month for planning and old station review. Internship (Months 1-3): 3 months. Month 1: Study AWS and upgrade hardware. Month 2: Design and adjust architecture. Month 3: Implement, test, and launch. Post-Launch: Up to 1 year for research. 6. Budget Estimation You can find the budget estimation on the AWS Pricing Calculator.\nOr you can download the Budget Estimation File.\nInfrastructure Costs AWS Services: AWS Lambda: $0.00/month (1,000 requests, 512 MB storage). S3 Standard: $0.15/month (6 GB, 2,100 requests, 1 GB scanned). Data Transfer: $0.02/month (1 GB inbound, 1 GB outbound). AWS Amplify: $0.35/month (256 MB, 500 ms requests). Amazon API Gateway: $0.01/month (2,000 requests). AWS Glue ETL Jobs: $0.02/month (2 DPUs). AWS Glue Crawlers: $0.07/month (1 crawler). MQTT (IoT Core): $0.08/month (5 devices, 45,000 messages). Total: $0.7/month, $8.40/12 months\nHardware: $265 one-time (Raspberry Pi 5 and sensors). 7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Network Outages: Medium impact, medium probability. Sensor Failures: High impact, low probability. Cost Overruns: Medium impact, low probability. Mitigation Strategies Network: Local storage on Raspberry Pi with Docker. Sensors: Regular checks and spares. Cost: AWS budget alerts and optimization. Contingency Plans Revert to manual methods if AWS fails. Use CloudFormation for cost-related rollbacks. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements: Real-time data and analytics replace manual processes.\nScalable to 10-15 stations.\nLong-term Value 1-year data foundation for AI research.\nReusable for future projects.\n"},{"uri":"https://addavid888.github.io/AWS-FCJ-Internship/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://addavid888.github.io/AWS-FCJ-Internship/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
