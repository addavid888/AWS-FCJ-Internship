During my time at First Cloud AI Journey Study Group from **08/09/2025** to **09/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.

I participated in **Rafilm: AI-Powered Movie Logging & Recommendation Platform** - a project of my team, through which I improved my skills in programming, communication, project management, and self studying.

Regarding work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, comply with workplace regulations, and actively engage with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
