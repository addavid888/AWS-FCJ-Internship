# Summary Report: Data Science on AWS - Workshop

### Event Objectives

- Introduce students and participants to **modern data science workflows using AWS Cloud**.
- Demonstrate how cloud services support **data processing, model training, deployment, and scaling**.
- Provide practical exposure through a **hands-on machine learning project** using real datasets.

### Speakers

- Van Hoang Kha – AWS Community Builder
- Bach Doan Vuong – Cloud Develops Engineer, AWS Community Builder

### Key Highlights

- Industry experts delivered sessions on data processing, data pipelines, and ML model deployment using cloud platforms.
- Overview of AWS Generative AI services and how they support various real-world applications.
- End-to-end walkthrough of building a sentiment analysis model using AWS-powered ML tools.

### Key Takeaways
- Data science on cloud requires understanding pipelines, infrastructure, and deployment workflows.
- Cloud services provide clear benefits in scalability, performance, and ease of experimentation, but come with cost considerations.
- Machine learning becomes more accessible when tied to hands-on, real-world demos rather than abstract theory.
- Exposure to industry practice helps bridge the gap between university learning and real engineering expectations.
