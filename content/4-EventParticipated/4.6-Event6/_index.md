# Summary Report: Building Agentic AI & Context Optimzation with Amazon Bedrock

### Event Objectives

- Walk attendees through the full journey from proof-of-concept prototypes to production-ready AI agents using Bedrock AgentCore.
- Show how AI agents (on AWS / multi-cloud) can help automate cloud infrastructure tasks: optimization, cost-saving, security, resource management.
- Provide hands-on exposure: from high-level architecture to real implementation using AI-powered workflows on cloud.
- Help attendees understand how to integrate AI agents in real-world cloud environments to streamline operations and reduce manual workload.

### Speakers

- Nguyen Gia Hung - Head of Solutions Architect, AWS
- Kien Nguyen - Solutions Architect, AWS
- Viet Pham, Founder - CEO, Diaflow
- Thang Ton, Co-founder & COO
- Henry Bui, Head of Engineering, CloudThinker
- Kha Van - AWS Community Builder

### Key Highlights

- Presentation of architecture and capabilities of CloudThinker’s AI-agent platform for cloud operations.
- Session on using Amazon Bedrock + CloudThinker’s “Agentic Orchestration” to build AI-driven workflows.
- Use case demo showing how agents can manage tasks like cost optimization, resource monitoring, security audits, or automated operations across clouds.
- A hands-on workshop segment (CloudThinker Hack) where participants get to try building or experimenting with agent-driven tasks themselves.
- Networking time plus lunch buffet — chance to talk with other attendees, maybe CloudThinker team, and exchange ideas.

### Key Takeaways

- Agentic AI (with proper orchestration) can reduce routine cloud-ops overhead and let developers/teams focus more on high-value work, not boilerplate ops.
- Multi-cloud automation and optimization are within reach using tools like CloudThinker — no need to build complex tooling from scratch.
- Real-world cloud management (cost, performance, security) benefits significantly from combining AI + automation + human oversight.
- Hands-on experience matters: using AI agents in a controlled setting helps you see tradeoffs, limitations, and potential real-world uses.
- With space for questions and discussion, there are real trade-offs and design decisions behind “automate everything.”

### Event Experience

- Presentations laid out clearly how AI, orchestration and cloud services combine to deliver cost-efficient, secure, and scalable operations. The demo and workshop helped ground those abstractions: you saw how agents analyze usage, optimize resources, or flag security issues — stuff that often eats up a lot of engineers’ time.
- All in all, the event struck a balance: neither too academic, nor pure sales-pitch — a practical, tool-driven exploration of what cloud + AI might look like now (or soon).
- For students, exposure to these tools gives a modern, practical glimpse into how cloud + AI + DevOps workflows might actually look in industry.
