- The event is designed to give both business-level and technical audiences value: whether you're decision-maker, enterprise leader, startup founder, or developer, there are relevant tracks.
- Real-world customer stories and cross-industry use cases help bridge the gap between cloud/AI theory and practical business adoption in Vietnam.
- The structure, from keynote to breakout supports both strategy-level thinking (digital transformation, industry disruption) and ground-level technical learning (migration, GenAI integration, modernization).
- Networking and directly engaging with AWS experts or partners could unlock collaboration, partnerships, and accelerate innovation for attendees or their organizations.
- For someone like me as a student, this setup offers a good way to get exposed to how cloud & AI are being used right now in real Vietnamese enterprises.
