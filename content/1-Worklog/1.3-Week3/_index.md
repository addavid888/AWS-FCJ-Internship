### Week 3 Achievements

- **Understood the EC2 architecture**:

  - EC2 instances run on a **hypervisor layer** (Nitro/KVM) atop physical hardware nodes.
  - Each instance uses an **AMI template** to define its OS and configuration.
  - Gained insight into how instance types define compute, memory, and networking capacity:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

- **Learned about Instance Store vs EBS**:

  - Instance Store provides **temporary, ultra-fast NVMe storage** tied to the hardware node.
  - EBS provides **persistent block storage** replicated across storage nodes within an AZ for reliability.
  - Understood use cases: instance store for high IOPS workloads, EBS for durability:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- **Explored EBS architecture and operations**:

  - Studied how EBS connects via a **dedicated EBS Network** within an Availability Zone.
  - Learned about **EBS volume types** (SSD, HDD), **EBS-optimized instances**, and **multi-attach** support.
  - Practiced creating, attaching, detaching, and taking **snapshots** for backup.

- **Configured EC2 instances and Key Pairs**:

  - Generated SSH key pairs for secure access.
  - Connected to EC2 via public subnet using SSH.
  - Understood key pair encryption and its link to private/public subnets.

- **Used User Data and Metadata for automation**:

  - Wrote bash scripts for boot-time installation of packages and environment setup.
  - Accessed metadata endpoints to retrieve configuration data (IP, hostname, SGs).
  - Learned to automate EC2 provisioning without manual SSH setup.

- **Gained familiarity with higher-level storage services**:

  - Overviewed **EFS** for shared POSIX file systems across instances.
  - Learned about **FSx** for Windows-based or high-performance workloads.
  - Explored **Application Migration Service** as a tool for moving workloads to AWS.

- Developed a clear understanding of **how compute and storage layers interact** inside an AWS Availability Zone, and how these form the foundation for higher-level services.
